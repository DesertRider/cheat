    "# Tutorial on serialization in Django Rest Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "In [his blog post](https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2019/02/01/creating-api-endpoint-django-rest-framework/),\n",
    "my colleague Dmitriy gave a good example of starting to use Django Rest Framework (DRF) with Django models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you might want to start learning more about DRF from its documentation. I\n",
    "found that just starting with the documentation was rather challenging for me,\n",
    "as there were some basic concepts assumed that I wasn't aware of. I thought in\n",
    "this post, I'd go over some of them. Then I found I was getting deeper and\n",
    "deeper into serialization, so this has ended up being all about serialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "And to state some of my own assumptions up front: for this post, I'll be\n",
    "assuming an API that uses JSON to transport data.\n",
    "\n",
    "(If you've seen the\n",
    "[first Tutorial on the DRF site](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/1-serialization/),\n",
    "there is some overlap in what this post covers, but then this post digs deeper\n",
    "into serialization while the DRF tutorial moves on to other aspects of building\n",
    "an API.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Serialization\n",
    "\n",
    "In our Django application, we're working with Python objects, but for our\n",
    "API we want to use a format called JSON to transport information over the\n",
    "network. Serializing is the process of converting Python objects\n",
    "to JSON, and deserializing is the process of converting JSON to Python objects\n",
    "again.\n",
    "\n",
    "(It helps me to think of \"serializing\" as creating a \"serial\" stream of bytes\n",
    "that can flow over a network connection, and \"deserializing\" as consuming a\n",
    "serial stream of bytes and turning it into something more useful again.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In DRF, serialization and deserialization are handled by the same class.\n",
    "This kind of makes sense, give that you want deserialization to be the\n",
    "reverse of serialization, but it can also be confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also turns out that writing a serializer class that can just serialize\n",
    "is pretty trivial, but when you start wanting it to deserialize, all sorts\n",
    "of complications appear.\n",
