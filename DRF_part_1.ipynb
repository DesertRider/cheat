    "# Tutorial on serialization in Django Rest Framework\n",

    "Now you might want to start learning more about DRF from its documentation. I\n",
    "found that just starting with the documentation was rather challenging for me,\n",
    "as there were some basic concepts assumed that I wasn't aware of. I thought in\n",
    "this post, I'd go over some of them. Then I found I was getting deeper and\n",
    "deeper into serialization, so this has ended up being all about serialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "And to state some of my own assumptions up front: for this post, I'll be\n",

    "that can flow over a network connection, and \"deserializing\" as consuming a\n",
    "serial stream of bytes and turning it into something more useful again.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In DRF, serialization and deserialization are handled by the same class.\n",
    "This kind of makes sense, give that you want deserialization to be the\n",
    "reverse of serialization, but it can also be confusing.\n",
